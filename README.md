# Cherish-Cakes-Landing-Page
This is a HTML file that describes the structure and content of a website. The website appears to be for a company called "Cherish Cakes".

The file begins with a declaration that it is an HTML5 document and specifies the character encoding used in the file.

In the <head> element, there are several <meta> tags that provide information about the website and how it should be displayed in the browser. There is also a <title> element, which specifies the title of the website, and several <link> elements that link to external resources, such as stylesheets, fonts, and scripts.

The <body> element contains the content of the website. It starts with a navigation bar, followed by a carousel (a slideshow of images). The rest of the content is divided into several sections, including "Menu", "About", and "Contact". Each section is identified by an id attribute and is linked to from the navigation bar.

There are also several external resources linked to in the file, such as Bootstrap, a popular framework for building responsive websites, and Font Awesome, a library of icons.
